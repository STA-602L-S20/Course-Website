# Probability review


---
## Discrete random variables

- A .hlight[random variable] is .hlight[discrete] if the set of all possible outcomes is .hlight[countable].

--

- The .hlight[probability mass function (pmf)] of a discrete random variable `\(Y\)`, `\(p(y)\)` describes the probability associated with each possible value of `\(Y\)`.

--

- `\(p(y)\)` has the following properties:

  1. `\(0 \leq p(y) \leq 1\)` for all values `\(y \in \mathcal{Y}\)`.
  
  2. `\(\sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} p(y) = 1\)`.


---
## Bernoulli distribution

- The .hlight[Bernoulli distribution] can be used to describe an experiment with two outcomes, such as
  + Flipping a coin (heads or tails);
  + Vote turnout (vote or not); and
  + The outcome of a basketball game (win or loss).

--

- In all cases, we can represent this as a binary random variable where the probability of "success" is `\(\theta\)` and the probability of "failure" is `\(1-\theta\)`.

--

- We usually write this as: `\(Y \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(\theta)\)`, where `\(\theta \in [0,1]\)`.

--

- It follows that
.block[
.small[
`$$\Pr(Y=y|\theta) = \theta^y(1-\theta)^{1-y}; \ \ \ y=0,1.$$`
]
]

--

- &lt;div class="question"&gt;
What is the mean of this distribution? What is the variance?
&lt;/div&gt;


---
## Binomial distribution

- The .hlight[binomial distribution] describes the number of successes from `\(n\)` independent Bernoulli trials.

--

- That is, `\(Y =\)` number of "successes" in `\(n\)` independent trials and `\(\theta\)` is the probability of success per trial.

--

- We usually write this as: `\(Y \sim \textrm{Bin}(n,\theta)\)`, where `\(\theta \in [0,1]\)`.

--

- The pmf is
.block[
.small[
`$$\Pr(Y=y|\theta,n) = {n \choose y} \theta^y(1-\theta)^{n-y}; \ \ \ y=0,1,\ldots,n.$$`
]
]

--

- **Example**: `\(Y =\)` number of individuals with type I diabetes out of a sample of `\(n\)` surveyed.

--

- Binomial likelihoods are commonly used in collecting data on proportions.

--

- &lt;div class="question"&gt;
What is the mean of this distribution? What is the variance?
&lt;/div&gt;


---
## Poisson distribution

- `\(Y \sim \textrm{Po}(\theta)\)` denotes that `\(Y\)` is a .hlight[Poisson random variable].

--

- The Poisson distribution is commonly used to model count data consisting of the number of events in a given time interval.

--

- The Poisson distribution is parameterized by `\(\theta\)` and the pmf is given by
.block[
.small[
`$$\Pr[Y = y | \theta] = \dfrac{\theta^y e^{-\theta}}{y!}; \ \ \ \ y=0,1,2,\ldots; \ \ \ \ \theta &gt; 0.$$`
]
]

--

- Similar to binomial but with no limit on the total number of counts.

--

- &lt;div class="question"&gt;
What is the mean of this distribution? What is the variance?
&lt;/div&gt;


---
## General discrete distributions

- Useful to consider general discrete distributions having an arbitrary form.

--

- Suppose `\(Y \in \{y_1^\star,\ldots,y_k^\star\}\)`. Then define `\(\Pr(Y = y_h^\star) = \pi_h\)` for each `\(h = 1,\ldots, k\)`. That is,
.block[
.small[
`$$\Pr[Y = y| \boldsymbol{\pi}] = \prod_h \pi_h^{\mathbb{1}[Y = y_h^\star]}; \ \ y \in \{y_1^\star,\ldots,y_k^\star\}$$`
]
]
  where `\(\boldsymbol{\pi} = (\pi_1,\ldots,\pi_k)\)`.

--

- `\((y_1^\star,\ldots,y_k^\star)\)` are "atoms" representing possible values for `\(Y\)`.

--

- For example, these may be words in a dictionary or values for education as a categorical variable. Useful for text data, categorical observations, etc.

--

- Can also write as `\(Y \sim \sum^k_{h=1} \pi_h \delta_{y_h^\star}\)`, where `\(\delta_{y_h^\star}\)` denotes a unit mass at `\(y_h^\star\)`.

--

- Often called the .hlight[categorical distribution] or .hlight[generalized Bernoulli distribution]. Also, see the .hlight[multinomial distribution].


---
## Continuous random variables

- The .hlight[probability density function (pdf)], `\(p(y)\)` or `\(f(y)\)`, of a continuous random variable `\(Y\)` has slightly different properties:
  
  1. `\(0 \leq f(y)\)` for all `\(y \in \mathcal{Y}\)`.
  
  2. `\(\int_{y \in \mathbb{R}} p(y) \textrm{d}y = 1\)`.
  
--

- The pdf for a continuous random variable is not necessarily less than 1. 

--

- Also, `\(p(y)\)` is NOT the probability of value `\(y\)`. 

--

- However, if `\(p(y_1) &gt; p(y_2)\)`, we say informally that `\(y_1\)` has a "higher probability" than `\(y_2\)`.


---
## Uniform density

- The simplest example of a continuous density is the .hlight[uniform density].

--

- `\(Y \sim \textrm{Unif}(a,b)\)` denotes density is uniform in interval `\((a,b)\)`.

--

- The pdf is simply
.block[
.small[
`$$f(y) = \dfrac{1}{b-a}; \ \ \ y  \in (a,b).$$`
]
]

--

- The cdf is
.block[
.small[
`$$F(y) = \Pr(Y \leq y) = \int^y_a \dfrac{1}{b-a} \textrm{d}z = \dfrac{y-a}{b-a}$$`
]
]

--

- The mean (expectation) is
.block[
.small[
`$$\dfrac{a+b}{2}$$`
]
]

- &lt;div class="question"&gt;
What is the variance? Also, can you prove the formula for the mean?
&lt;/div&gt;

---
## Beta density

- The uniform density can be used as a prior for a probability if `\((a,b) \subset (0,1)\)`.

--

- However, it is very inflexible clearly. &lt;div class="question"&gt;
Why?
&lt;/div&gt;

--

- An alternative for `\(y \in \mathcal{Y}\)` is the .hlight[beta density], written as `\(Y \sim \textrm{Beta}(a,b)\)`, with
.block[
.small[
`$$f(y) = \frac{1}{B(a,b)} y^{a-1} (1-y)^{b-1}; \ \ \ y  \in (0,1), \ a &gt; 0, \ b &gt; 0.$$`
]
]

  where `\(B(a,b) = \dfrac{\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b)}{\Gamma(a+b)}\)`. `\(\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!\)` for any positive integer `\(n\)`.
  
--

- As we have already seen, the beta density is quite flexible in characterizing a broad variety of densities on `\((0,1)\)`.

--

- &lt;div class="question"&gt;
Beta(1,1) is the same as Unif(0,1). Workout the pdfs to convince yourself!
&lt;/div&gt;


---
## Gamma density

- The .hlight[gamma density] will be useful as a prior for parameters that are strictly positive.

--

- For random variables `\(Y \sim \textrm{Ga}(a,b)\)`, we have the pdf
.block[
.small[
`$$f(y) = \frac{b^a}{\Gamma(a)} y^{a-1}e^{-by}; \ \ \ y  \in (0,\infty), \ a &gt; 0, \ b &gt; 0.$$`
]
]

--

- Properties:
.block[
.small[
`$$\mathbb{E}[Y] = \dfrac{a}{b}; \ \ \mathbb{V}[Y] = \dfrac{a}{b^2}.$$`
]
]

--

- **Note**: parameterizations of the gamma distribution vary!

--

- Under this parameterization, if `\(Y \sim \textrm{Ga}(1,\theta)\)`, then `\(Y \sim \textrm{Exp}(\theta)\)`, that is, the .hlight[exponential distribution].


---
## Continuous joint distributions

- Suppose we have two random variables `\(\theta = (\theta_1,\theta_2)\)`.

--

- Their **joint** distribution function is
.block[
.small[
`$$\Pr(\theta_1 \leq a,\theta_2 \leq b) = \int^a_{-\infty} \int^b_{-\infty} p(\theta_1,\theta_2) \textrm{d}\theta_1\textrm{d}\theta_2,$$`
]
]

  where `\(p(\theta_1,\theta_2)\)` is the joint probability density function (pdf).
  
--

- The **marginal** density of `\(\theta_1\)` can be obtained by
.block[
.small[
`$$p(\theta_1) = \int^\infty_{-\infty} p(\theta_1,\theta_2) \textrm{d}\theta_2,$$`
]
]

  which is referred to as marginalizing out `\(\theta_2\)`.
  
--

- We will be doing a lot of "marginalizations" so take note!


---
## Factorizing joint densities and independence

- The joint density `\(p(\theta_1,\theta_2)\)` can be factorized as
.block[
.small[
`$$p(\theta_1,\theta_2) = p(\theta_1|\theta_2)p(\theta_2), \ \ \ \textrm{or} \ \ \ p(\theta_1,\theta_2) = p(\theta_2|\theta_1)p(\theta_1).$$`
]
]

--

- For independent random variables, the joint density equals the product of the marginals:
.block[
.small[
`$$p(\theta_1,\theta_2) = p(\theta_1)p(\theta_2).$$`
]
]

--

- This implies that `\(p(\theta_2|\theta_1) = p(\theta_2)\)` and `\(p(\theta_1|\theta_2) = p(\theta_1)\)` under independence.

--

- These relationships extend automatically to `\(\theta = (\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_p)\)`. That is,
.block[
.small[
`$$p(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_p) = \prod^p_{j=1} p(\theta_j),$$`
]
]

  under mutual independence of the elements of the `\(\theta\)` vector.
  

---
## Conditional independence

- Suppose `\(y_i \overset{iid}{\sim} f(\theta)\)` for `\(i = 1,\ldots,n\)`.

--

- Data `\(\{y_i\}\)` are independent &amp; identically distributed draws from distribution `\(f(\theta)\)`.

--

- The data are said to be .hlight[conditionally independent] given `\(\theta\)`.
.block[
.small[
`$$L(y; \theta) = \prod^n_{i=1} f(y_i; \theta),$$`
]
]

  where `\(L(y; \theta) =\)` likelihood of the data conditionally on `\(\theta\)`.
  
--

- The .hlight[marginal likelihood] of the data is
.block[
.small[
`$$L(y) = \int L(y; \theta)p(\theta)\textrm{d}\theta.$$`
]
]

--

- `\(L(y)\)` can no longer be written as a product of densities as in `\(\prod^n_{i=1} h(y_i)\)`; we lose independence when we marginalize out `\(\theta\)`.


---
## Exchangeability

- In marginalizing out `\(\theta\)`, the observations `\(\{y_i\}\)` are no longer independent.

--

- `\(\{y_i\}\)` are .hlight[exchangeable] if `\(p(y_1,\ldots,y_n) = p(y_{\pi_1},\ldots,y_{\pi_n})\)`, for all permutations `\(\pi\)` of `\(\{1,\ldots,n\}\)`.

--

- .hlight[de Finetti's Theorem]: Suppose `\(\{y_i\}\)` are exchangeable under above definition for any `\(n\)`. Then
.block[
.small[
`$$p(y_1,\ldots,y_n) = \int \left[ \prod^n_{i=1} f(y_i; \theta) \right] p(\theta)\textrm{d}\theta.$$`
]
]

  for some `\(\theta\)`, prior distribution `\(p(\theta)\)` and sampling model `\(f(y_i;\theta)\)`.
  
--

- Simply put, de Finetti's Theorem states that exchangeable observations are conditionally independent relative to some parameter.

--

- de Finetti's Theorem is critical in providing a motivation for using parameters and for putting priors on parameters.

# Introduction to Bayesian Inference (Cont'd)



---
## Frequentist inference

- Given **data** `\(\{y_i\}\)` and an **unknown parameter** `\(\theta\)`, estimate said `\(\theta\)`.

--

- How to estimate `\(\theta\)` under the frequentist paradigm?
  + Maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) 
  + Method of moments
  + and so on...
  
--

- Frequentist ML estimation finds the one value of `\(\theta\)` that maximizes the likelihood.

--

- Typically uses large sample (asymptotic) theory to obtain confidence intervals and do hypothesis testing.


---
## Bayesian inference

- Once again, given **data** `\(\{y_i\}\)` and an **unknown parameter** `\(\theta\)`, estimate said `\(\theta\)`.

--

- Bayesians update their prior information for `\(\theta\)` with information in the data `\(\{y_i\}\)`, to obtain the posterior density `\(p(\theta | y)\)`.

--

- Personally, I prefer being able to obtain posterior densities that describe my parameter, instead of estimated summaries (usually measures of central tendency) along with confidence intervals.

--

- Bayes' theorem - reminder: 
.block[
.small[
`$$p(\theta | y) = \frac{p(\theta)L(y;\theta)}{\int_{\Theta}p(\tilde{\theta})L(y; \tilde{\theta}) \textrm{d}\tilde{\theta}} = \frac{p(\theta)L(y;\theta)}{L(y)}$$`
]
]


---
## Comments on the posterior density

- The posterior density is more concentrated than the prior &amp; quantifies learning about `\(\theta\)`.

--

- In fact, this is the optimal way to learn from data - see discussion in Hoff chapter 1.

--

- As more &amp; more data become available, posterior density will converge to a normal (Gaussian) density centered on the MLE (Bayes central limit theorem).

--

- In finite samples for limited data, the posterior can be highly skewed &amp; noticeably non-Gaussian.



---
## Conjugacy

- Starting with an arbitrary prior density `\(p(\theta)\)` &amp; likelihood `\(L(y;\theta)\)` we may encounter problems in calculating the
posterior density `\(p(\theta | y)\)`.

--

- In particular, you may notice the denominator in the Bayes' rule: 
.block[
.small[
`$$L(y) = \int_{\Theta}p(\tilde{\theta})L(y; \tilde{\theta}) \textrm{d}\tilde{\theta}.$$`
]
]
  This integral may not be analytically tractable!

--

- When the prior is .hlight[conjugate] however, the marginal likelihood can be calculated analytically.

--

- .hlight[Conjugacy] `\(\Rightarrow\)` the posterior has the same form as the prior.

--

- Often useful to think of hyperparameters of a conjugate prior distribution as corresponding to having observed a certain number of (historical) pseudo-observations with properties specified by the parameters.

--

- Conjugate priors make calculations easy but may not represent our prior information well.



---
## Kernels

- In Bayesian statistics, the .hlight[kernel] of a pdf omits any multipliers that do not depend on the random variable or parameter we care about.

--

- For many distributions, the kernel is in a simple form but the normalizing constant complicates calculations.

--

- If one recognizes the kernel as that matching a known distribution, then the normalizing factor can be reinstated. This is a very MAJOR TRICK we will use to calculate posterior distributions.

--

- For example, the normal density is given by
.block[
.small[
`$$p(y|\mu,\sigma^2) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\dfrac{(y-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$`
]
]

  but the kernel is just
.block[
.small[
`$$p(y|\mu,\sigma^2) \propto e^{-\dfrac{(y-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}.$$`
]
]


---
## Bernoulli data

- Back to our example: suppose `\(\theta \in (0,1)\)` is the population proportion of individuals with diabetes in the US.

--

- Suppose we take a sample of `\(n\)` individuals and record whether or not they have diabetes (as binary: 0,1). 

--

- Then we can use the Bernoulli distribution as the sampling distribution. also, we already established that we can use a beta prior for `\(\theta\)`.



---
## Bernoulli data

- Generally, it turns out that if 
  + `\(f(y_i; \theta): y_i \overset{iid}{\sim} \textrm{Bernoulli}(\theta)\)` for `\(i = 1,\ldots,n\)`, and
  + `\(p(\theta): \theta \sim \textrm{Beta}(a,b)\)`,
  
  then the posterior distribution is also a beta distribution.
  
--

- &lt;div class="question"&gt;
Can we derive the posterior distribution and its parameters? Let's do some work on the board!
&lt;/div&gt;

--

- Updating a beta prior with a Bernoulli likelihood leads to a beta posterior - we have conjugacy!

--

- Specifically, we have.
.block[
.small[
`$$p(\theta | \{y_i\}): \theta | \{y_i\} \sim \textrm{Beta}(a+\sum y_i,b+n-\sum y_i).$$`
]
]

--

- This is the .hlight[beta-Bernoulli model]. More generally, this is just the .hlight[beta-binomial model].



---
## Beta-binomial in more detail

- Suppose the likelihood of the data is
.block[
.small[
`$$L(y; \theta) = {n \choose y} \theta^y(1-\theta)^{n-y}.$$`
]
]


--

- Suppose also that we have a `\(\textrm{Beta}(a,b)\)` prior on the probability `\(\theta\)`.

--

- Then the posterior density then has the beta form
.block[
.small[
`$$\pi(\theta | y) = \textrm{Beta}(a+y,b+n-y).$$`
]
]

--

- The posterior has expectation
.block[
.small[
`$$\mathbb{E}(\theta | y) = \dfrac{a+y}{a+b+n} = \dfrac{a+b}{a+b+n} \times \textrm{prior mean} + \dfrac{n}{a+b+n} \times \textrm{sample mean}.$$`
]
]

--

- For this specification, sometimes `\(a\)` and `\(b\)` are interpreted as "prior data" with a interpreted as the prior number of 1's, `\(b\)` as the prior number of 0's, and `\(a + b\)` as the prior sample size.

--

- As we get more and more data, the majority of our information about `\(\theta\)` comes from the data as opposed to the prior.



---
## Binomial data

- For example, suppose you want to find the Bayesian estimate of the probability `\(\theta\)` that a coin comes up heads.

--

- Before you see the data, you express your uncertainty about `\(\theta\)` through the prior `\(p(\theta) = \textrm{Beta}(2,2)\)`

--

- Now suppose you observe 10 tosses, of which only 1 was heads.

--

- Then, the posterior density `\(p(\theta \,|\, y, n)\)` is `\(\mbox{Beta}(3, 11)\)`.



---
## Binomial data

- Recall that the mean of `\(\mbox{Beta}(a,b)\)` is `\(a/(a+b)\)`.

--

- That means, before you saw the data, you thought the mean for `\(\theta\)` was 2/(2+2) = 0.5. 

--

- However, after seeing the data, you believe it is 3/(3+11) = 0.214.

--

- The variance of `\(\mbox{Beta}(a,b)\)` is `\(ab/[(a+b)^2(a+b+1)]\)`.

--

- So before you saw data, your uncertainty about `\(\theta\)` (i.e., your standard deviation) was `\(\sqrt{4/[4^2 \times 5]} = 0.22\)`. 

--

- However, after seeing 1 Heads in 10 tosses, your uncertainty is 0.106.

--

- Clearly, as the number of tosses goes to infinity, your uncertainty goes to zero.


---
## Operationalizing data analysis

We will explore another example soon but first, how should we approach data analysis in general?

--

- .hlight[Step 1]. State the question.

--

- .hlight[Step 2]. Collect the data.

--

- .hlight[Step 3]. Explore the data.

--

- .hlight[Step 4]. Formulate and state a modeling framework. 

--

- .hlight[Step 5]. Check your models.

--

- .hlight[Step 6]. Answer the question.


---
## Example: rare events

- .hlight[Step 1]. State the question:
  + What is the prevalence of an infectious disease in a small city?
  + Why? High prevalence means more public health precautions are recommended.
  
--

- .hlight[Step 2]. Collect the data:
  + Suppose you collect a small random sample of 20 individuals.
  
--

- .hlight[Step 3]. Explore the data:
  + Let `\(Y\)` denote the unknown number of infected individuals in the sample.



---
## Example: rare events

- .hlight[Step 4]. Formulate and state a modeling framework:
  + Parameter of interest: `\(\theta\)` is the fraction of infected individuals in the city.
  + Sampling model: a reasonable model for `\(Y\)` can be `\(\textrm{Bin}(20,\theta)\)`
  
&lt;img src="img/binomial_histograms.png" width="105" height="370px" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
## Example: rare events

- .hlight[Step 4]. Formulate and state a modeling framework:
  + Prior specification: information from previous studies — infection rate in “comparable cities” ranges from 0.05 to
0.20 with an average of 0.10. So maybe a standard deviation of roughly 0.05?
  + What is a good prior? The **expected value** of `\(\theta\)` close to 0.10 and the **variance** close to 0.05.
  + Possible option: `\(\mbox{Beta}(3.5,31.5)\)` or maybe even `\(\mbox{Beta}(3,32)\)`?
  &lt;img src="02-one-parameter-models-I_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
## Example: rare events

- .hlight[Step 4]. Formulate and state a modeling framework:
  + Under `\(\mbox{Beta}(3,32)\)`, `\(\Pr(\theta &lt; 0.1) \approx 0.67\)`.
  + Posterior distribution for the model: `\((\theta | Y=y) = \textrm{Beta}(a+y,b+n-y)\)`
  + Suppose `\(Y=0\)`. Then, `\((\theta | Y=y) = \textrm{Beta}(3,32+20)\)`
&lt;img src="02-one-parameter-models-I_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;



---
## Example: rare events

- .hlight[Step 5]. Check your models:
  + Compare performance of posterior mean and posterior probability that `\(\theta &lt; 0.1\)`.
  + Under `\(\mbox{Beta}(3,52)\)`, 
      - `\(\Pr(\theta &lt; 0.1 | Y=y) \approx 0.92\)`. More confidence in low values of `\(\theta\)`.
      - For `\(\mathbb{E}(\theta | Y=y)\)`, we have
.block[
.small[
$$
`\begin{split}
\mathbb{E}(\theta | y) &amp; = \dfrac{a+y}{a+b+n} = \dfrac{3}{52} = 0.058.\\
\end{split}`
$$
]
]
      - Recall that the prior mean is `\(a/(a+b)=0.09\)`. Thus, we can see how that contributes to the prior mean.
.block[
.small[
$$
`\begin{split}
\mathbb{E}(\theta | y) &amp; = \dfrac{a+b}{a+b+n} \times \textrm{prior mean} + \dfrac{n}{a+b+n} \times \textrm{sample mean}\\
&amp; = \dfrac{a+b}{a+b+n} \times \dfrac{a}{a+b} + \dfrac{n}{a+b+n} \times \dfrac{y}{n}\\
&amp; = \dfrac{35}{52} \times \dfrac{3}{35} + \dfrac{20}{52} \times \dfrac{0}{n} = \dfrac{3}{52} = 0.058.\\
\end{split}`
$$
]
]



---
## Example: rare events

- .hlight[Step 6]. Answer the question:
  + People with low prior expectations are generally at least `\(90\%\)` certain that the infection rate is below 0.10.
  + `\(\pi(\theta | Y)\)` is to the left of `\(\pi(\theta)\)` because the observation `\(Y=0\)` provides evidence of a low value of `\(\theta\)`.
  + `\(\pi(\theta | Y)\)` is more peaked than `\(\pi(\theta)\)` because it combines information and so contains more information than `\(\pi(\theta)\)` alone.
  + The posterior expectation is 0.058.
  + The posterior mode is 0.04.
      - Note, for `\(\mbox{Beta}(a,b)\)`, the mode is `\((a-1)/(a+b-2)\)`.
  + The posterior probability that `\(\theta &lt; 0.1\)` is 0.92.
